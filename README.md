Personal Finance Dashboard Pro (Backend) - The project is not being completed yet, it was just started by me a few days ago. But I have pitched this software to multiple Hackathons and received positive feedback, and so I am implementing this project.
A premium backend service for a personal finance application designed to provide secure, automated financial insights.

## Project Requirements
This outlines the functional and technical project requirements.

Functional Requirements
The system must provide the following functionality:

User Management: Users must be able to sign up for a new account and securely log in.

Account Linking: The system must facilitate linking bank accounts using a secure third-party service (Plaid).

Data Synchronization: The system must synchronize transaction data for all the linked accounts on a predetermined schedule.

Data Integrity: The app must handle new, changed, and deleted transactions correctly to maintain the user's financial data up-to-date.

Transaction Categorization: Transactions must be automatically categorized using 'pre-defined, rules-based' engine.

Data Retrieval: Authorized users must be provided with summarized financial data, i.e., expenditures by category summaries.

Technical Requirements
The following technologies and tools are required to implement and deploy this project:

Platform: Java JDK 17 or later

Framework: Spring Boot 3.x

Database: MySQL Server

Build Tool: Apache Maven

External Services: A Developer Sandbox environment Plaid API key.

## Project Deliverables
This section describes the functionality and components delivered as part of this project's current phase.

Overview
The significant deliverable is a secure, scalable, and robust backend service that forms the core of a modern personal finance app. The service is architecturally designed using professional software design patterns to ensure it is maintainable and high-performance.

Key Delivered Features
Secure Authentication Module: A complete user registration and login module using Spring Security and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate user data and all secure API endpoints.

Bank Integration Service: A fully featured and encapsulated module for securely retrieving user bank accounts using the Plaid API. This service handles all token exchanges and secure storage of credentials needed.

Automated Transaction Processing Engine: An extremely sophisticated, scheduled background subsystem that synchronizes transactions continuously. It paginates judiciously and processes transactions in efficient batches.

Rule-Based Categorization Engine: An extremely smart service that automatically scans and categorizes user transactions (e.g., "Groceries," "Transportation," "Shopping"), enabling immediate financial insight without needing explicit user intervention.

RESTful API
The service exposes a complete RESTful API as a primary deliverable for customer applications. The most critical endpoints are:

Authentication (/api/auth): Endpoints for user registration (/register) and login (/login).

Plaid Integration (/api/plaid): Endpoints to manage the bank link process (/create-link-token, /exchange-public-token) and trigger on-demand data syncs (/sync-transactions).

Dashboard Data (/api/dashboard): A secure endpoint (/) to provide aggregated financial information to authenticated users for frontend display.

## Future Roadmap & Vision
This section explains the vision of taking the project from where it currently stands and turning it into a fully developed, cloud-native app.

Phase 1: Frontend Development (Q4 2025)
The second step is to design a responsive, modern user interface to invoke the backend API.

Framework: React with TypeScript for type-safe and maintainable frontend codebase.

Styling: Tailwind CSS for utility-first, modern design system.

UI Components: Professional component library like Shadcn/UI will be used to offer a high-quality user experience.

Data Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs will be implemented using Recharts to provide users conclusive financial insights.

Major UI Features:

An interactive dashboard showing breakdowns of spending.

A breakpointed transactions table with sorting and filtering capabilities.

A rich-feature interface for updating and creating month-by-month budgets.

Phase 2: High-Value Backend Features (Q1 2026)
After the basic backend and frontend are established, the development will shift towards adding high-value, intelligent features.

Smart Budgeting: Integrate machine learning to provide users with AI-based budgeting suggestions based on their historical spending habits.

Investment Tracking: Integrate with a second financial API (e.g., IEX Cloud) to allow users to track the performance of their investment portfolios.

Financial Goal Setting: Implement a feature for users to set, track, and keep track of financial goals, like vacation money or down payment.

User Notifications: Create a system to alert users of significant transactions, budget exceeds, and pending bills.

Phase 3: Move to Cloud-Native Architecture (Q2 2026)
The final phase involves re-architecting the application for scalability, reliability, and performance utilizing leading-edge cloud technologies.

Microservices Architecture: The current monolith will be split into distinct, independent microservices strategically. For example, a new Notification Service will be developed with C# and .NET for all user notifications.

Cloud Platform: The application will be migrated en masse to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Containerization & Orchestration: All Java and .NET backend services will be containerized using Docker. The containers will be orchestrated and managed using Kubernetes (via AWS EKS) for auto-scaling and high availability.

Managed Services: The on-prem MySQL database will be transitioned to Amazon RDS for greater reliability and manageability. The static React frontend will be hosted on AWS S3 and distributed globally using the Amazon CloudFront CDN for low-latency access.

CI/CD Pipeline: There is going to be a full CI/CD pipeline set up utilizing GitHub Actions for auto-testing and deployment to the AWS environment. 

## Personal Development & Learning
I am learning AWS, C# .NET, and Kubernetes actively to increase my capability. My goal is to apply these technologies right away on the next phases of this project, particularly to re-engineer the architecture into a cloud-native, scalable microservices system as outlined in the roadmap. This project serves as both portfolio demonstration and also hands-on lab for the learning of these enterprise technologies.
